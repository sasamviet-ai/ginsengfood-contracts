# IVR-20 - Phase / Task / TODO Plan

Trạng thái: `IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG_BASELINE`  
Phase: 8 - IVR Order Confirmation  
Vai trò: Backlog triển khai chi tiết từ SRS/SDS/contract sang API, DB, service, admin, adapter, test, release.

## 1. Mục tiêu

Tài liệu này chia Phase 8 thành các slice triển khai có thứ tự, dependency, deliverable và done gate. Đây là tài liệu điều phối dev, không phải bằng chứng release.

## 2. Definition of Ready

Một task được đưa vào dev khi:

- Có source/SRS/SDS/contract tham chiếu.
- Có input/output rõ.
- Có owner và dependency rõ.
- Có test expected rõ.
- Không yêu cầu Owner Decision chưa được chốt, trừ khi task chỉ tạo guard/placeholder an toàn.

## 3. Definition of Done

Một task được xem là done khi:

- Code/test/docs liên quan được cập nhật.
- Unit/integration tests pass.
- Không bypass source-of-truth.
- Có audit/evidence nếu task rủi ro.
- Feature flag/release gate không bị mở sai.
- Contract validator vẫn pass nếu có chỉnh contract.

## 6. P0 blockers

Phase 8 must stop immediately if:

- IVR/SIM can directly update order state.
- Real customer call flag is enabled before release gate.
- Technical failure is counted as no-answer.
- Golden Hour creates attempt 3.
- 24/7 creates attempt 4.
- Admin action bypasses Sale Lock/Recall/Suppression/opt-out.
- Raw phone appears in logs/UI without approved policy.
- Evidence/audit is missing for high-risk transitions.

## 7. Owner Decision Required backlog

| Decision | Needed before |
| --- | --- |
| Trusted customer threshold and risk flags | P8.3/P8.4 production use. |
| Permanent invalid phone criteria | P8.4. |
| Technical retry count/backoff | P8.6/P8.7. |
| SIM Gateway hardware/API protocol | P8.6 internal adapter. |
| Recording allowed or prohibited | P8.9/P8.10. |
| Retention duration by data class | P8.9/P8.10. |
| Pilot real customer scope | P8.11. |
| Notification template after Core cancellation | Notification owner phase. |

## 8. Suggested implementation order

1. Finish docs/contracts review.
2. Implement DB foundation.
3. Implement API shell with fake adapter only.
4. Implement Order Core task publisher.
5. Implement eligibility/policy/scheduler.
6. Implement fake SIM flow and result callback.
7. Implement admin monitoring/actions.
8. Implement evidence/security/privacy gates.
9. Run dry-run and internal-number smoke.
10. Request owner decision for pilot.

## 9. Acceptance criteria

- Backlog covers API, DB, services, workflow, admin, security, privacy, test, release.
- Every task has deliverable and done gate.
- P0 blockers and owner decisions are explicit.
- Implementation order does not require real customer call before smoke/release evidence.
